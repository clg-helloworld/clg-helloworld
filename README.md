  Software Developer, with more than 8 years of experience programming and at the same time in the last 2 years ago as Project Lead. I‚Äôve worked with different web technology environments mainly as a Backend Developer.
I can evaluate and deploy some technological projects at different levels, from virtual cloud environments (Google Cloud Platform, Azure, Huawei Cloud) until write/reading programming language codes like PHP, JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, and others. Additionally, I‚Äôve experience with classical databases (MySQL and MSSQL ‚Äì SQL Server).
My last projects have been deploying and developing with NodeJS, some of them API‚Äôs homemade or requested external services. Additionally, I‚Äôm learning and practicing React and React Native to provide better and updated solutions at different levels.
Right now, I‚Äôve B1 Intermediate English level and I‚Äôm taking classes with Tronwell‚Äôs program. Below you will find my LinkedIn and IG
